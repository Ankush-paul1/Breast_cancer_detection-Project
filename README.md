"# Breast_cancer_detection-Project" 

This project is focused on detecting breast cancer using machine learning algorithms. It leverages a dataset of breast cancer cases and applies various machine learning techniques to classify whether a tumor is benign or malignant based on clinical features.

-->Introduction

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide. Early detection through machine learning models can assist medical professionals in making accurate diagnoses. This project applies a supervised learning approach using various machine learning algorithms to predict whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant based on its characteristics.

-->Technologies Used

1. Python 3.x

2. Scikit-learn

3. Pandas

4. Numpy

5. Matplotlib / Seaborn (for data visualization)

6. Jupyter Notebook

7. Dataset

We have used the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset. It contains 569 samples, each described by 30 numeric features related to the tumor's size and shape.

Target Variable: Diagnosis (Benign or Malignant)

Features: Radius, Texture, Perimeter, Area, Smoothness, etc.

-->Installation

step 1. Clone the repository:
      git clone https://github.com/your-username/Breast_cancer_detection-Project.git
      cd Breast_cancer_detection-Project

step 2. Install the required libraries:
     
      pip install numpy
      
      pip install pandas
      
      pip install matplotlib
      
      pip install seaborn
      
      pip install scikit-learn


      install these libraries using above command: 

step 3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
      jupyter notebook

-->Usage

1. Data Preprocessing

2. Model Training:
      SVM, logistic regression, KNN classifier, Naive-bayes classifier, decision tree, random forest classifier, AdaBoost classifier, XGboost classifier.

      From all these models "XGboost classifier" gives the best fit accuracy with 98% approximately.
   
4. Model Evaluation

5. Visualization

-->Model Evaluation

The model performance is evaluated using several metrics:

Accuracy: Overall accuracy of the model.

Precision: The precision for malignant tumor prediction.

Recall: The recall for benign tumor prediction.

F1 Score: A balance between precision and recall.

The results are plotted using confusion matrices, ROC curves, and precision-recall curves.

-->Future Work

Incorporate deep learning models using neural networks.

Explore hyperparameter tuning for optimizing model performance.

Deploy the model using a web framework (e.g., Flask or Django).

Build a user-friendly front-end interface for end-users.
